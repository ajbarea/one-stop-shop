## Executive Summary

RIT students today struggle with keeping track of their course schedules. With the mobile version of MyCourses, Pulse, lacking basic features, as well as having to rely on third-party calendar applications to manage schedules and deadlines, students and faculty do not currently have a single application to solve these problems.

Having one application to manage all course needs for students and faculty would be a tremendous help to those who are currently struggling to manage their time. Students using multiple applications currently often forget to update their external calendars. The announcements relayed by Pulse are often unreliable, leading to students missing announcements and being forced onto the mobile site of MyCourses when they want to see more details.

The One Stop Shop aims to be that single application. With the full functionality of MyCourses with a calendar to help keep track of student schedules, RIT students will no longer have to rely on multiple applications to keep track of deadlines, grades, and other course-related events. Faculty and course assistants will also be able to post announcements and update grades on the go, something not currently possible without navigating the subpar MyCourses mobile site.

## Requirements

### Definition of MVP
The One Stop Shop application seeks to address the shortfalls of RIT’s apps by providing a single, mobile-friendly solution for students, faculty, and course assistants. The app will allow students to manage their schedules, track homework deadlines, and receive course-related notifications. Faculty will have the tools to manage classes, assignments, and interact with students, while course assistants will be able to edit grades directly from the app. Regardless of the user, the full functionality of MyCourses will be available anywhere, with even more features to help create a single application that every student can utilize instead of relying on outside resources. One Stop Shop app provides a user-friendly interface for quick access to course-related tasks. The app enables better communication between students, faculty, and course assistants through announcements, notifications, and scheduling tools.
